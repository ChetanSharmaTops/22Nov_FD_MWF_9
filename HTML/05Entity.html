    <p>
      An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand
      (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). HTML entities are frequently used to
      display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML
      code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). You can also
      use HTML character entities in place of other characters that are
      difficult to type with a standard keyboard.
